***🔭 Future Development: Kernel Koala Roadmap***

📌 Vision

Kernel Koala aims to become a lightweight, pluggable eBPF-based L4 traffic inspection and security tool, providing real-time visibility, long-term observability, and proactive protection of your containerized workloads and cloud infrastructure.

✅ Planned Features

1. 🔄 Backend Integration

***gRPC/HTTP API backend to collect and store network events***
***PostgreSQL / ClickHouse / InfluxDB support for efficient long-term storage***
***Support for OpenTelemetry trace correlation to enrich network flows with app-level spans***
***Custom retention and compression for historical traffic analysis***

2. 📊 Grafana & Dashboards

***Out-of-the-box Grafana dashboards***
  ***Traffic by pod, namespace, protocol, and direction***
  ***TCP flag patterns (SYN floods, RST spikes, etc.)***
  ***Suspicious port scans or traffic bursts***
***Integration with Loki / Tempo for full-stack observability***

3. 🔐 Security Monitoring & Anomaly Detection

***Real-time detection of:***
  => Port scans
  => DoS/DDoS traffic patterns
  => Unusual east-west traffic inside clusters
***Optional packet dropping with policy enforcement via eBPF***
***Anomaly scoring (baseline learning + deviation)***

4. 🧠 Smart Filtering & Performance Optimization
  => Protocol whitelisting
  => Source/destination filtering to reduce noise
  => Dynamic sampling (e.g., trace 1 out of N packets)

5. 🚀 Deployment & Management
  => Helm chart for easy deployment on Kubernetes
  => Systemd service for bare-metal or VM-based installs
  => Role-based access control (RBAC) for audit and multi-tenant environments

🧪 Prototype Flow

```bash
+-------------+       +-------------+       +--------------+       +-----------+
| eBPF tc/xdp |  -->  | Koala Agent |  -->  | Koala Server |  -->  | Grafana   |
| (Ingress/   |       | (Go)        |       | + DB         |       | Dashboards|
|  Egress)    |       +-------------+       +--------------+       +-----------+
+-------------+

```

***📉 Known Limitations (To Be Improved)***

```note
Might miss some packets under high load or due to perf buffer limits

tc hooks add minor latency and are interface-specific

No native L7 support (e.g., HTTP, DNS parsing) — yet

```
